/* 
 * This file contains declarations of a variety of useful utilities. Currently,
 * it contains:
 *  - Concepts:
 *   - Printable, if << is a defined operator.
 *   - Readable, if >> is a defined operator.
 * - Vector Operations:
 *   - Printing a vector (in different formats, see vector_print_* globals).
 *   - Reading a vector with a known number of elements.
 * - Fast IO: Sets up fast input and output for competitive programming.
 * - Range: An implementation of python's range() function, as an int returing iterator.
